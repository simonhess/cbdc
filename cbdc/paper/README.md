# Overview on the Contents of the folder “Benchmark Model Simulation Results”

The folder contains:

- The Summary Tables with the quasi-SS characterization in the Baseline Scenario and the Sensitivity Experiments discusses in the working paper available <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2664125"> here</a> 

- The Summary Tables of the Cross Correlation Analysis in the Baseline and in Each Sensitivity

- All the Plots Produced in the Experiments. In the case of the sensitivity experiments lighter grey lines correspond to higher values of the parameter.

- The Executable Files to run simulations of the benchmark model by your own (in both the Baseline and Sensitivity Scenarios) and the R Scripts required to transform and analyze the results, and plot the figures. (See Read Me doc. in the “Launch Simulations” Folder)
